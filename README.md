# GettingDataAssignment
 Week 4 assignment for GettingData course

The R code run_analysis.R should be run (I wrote in Rstudio 1.2.5019).

R version 3.6.1 (2019-07-05)
Platform: x86_64-apple-darwin15.6.0 (64-bit)
Running under: macOS Mojave 10.14.6

With dplyr_0.8.3 attached.

The UCI Har dataset must be downloaded as a zip file and then extracted from zip.  Setwd() to the top folder of the extracted folder structure (above test and train folders)

Run the whole code from top to bottom (it is not a function so just select all and run)
