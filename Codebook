Description of variables

The variables used for this assignment use the following terminology:

Mean - the mean value of the measurement
STD - the standard deviation of the measurement

Freq - indicates the measurement is in the frequency domain
Time - indicates the measurement is in the time domain

Acc - indicates the measurement is from the accelerometer
Gyro - indicates the measurement is from the gyroscope
Body - means that this is the signal which is based on the body of the subject
Gravity - means that this is the signal which is based on the gravitational force
Jerk - indicates a derivative of either of the linear accelerations (AccJerk) or angular velocity (GyroJerk)

These last 5 indicators can be strung together in a variable name and then have the composite meaning,
for example:  BodyAcc = the signal of the accelerometer which is based on the subject's body.
for example:  BodyGyroJerk = the Jerk (derivative) of the the signal of the gyroscope which is based on the subject's body.

Mag - is where the Euclidean norm of the 3D signals has been used to get the magnitude

In_X, In_Y, In_Z - indicate the measurement is in the x axis, in the y axis, in the z axis respectively.
